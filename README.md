## Why Try the Pomodoro Technique? 🙌
- Struggling with tiny distractions that throw off your entire day?
- Often working beyond your peak productivity hours?
- Drowning in endless tasks that seem to stretch forever (like prepping for exams or researching for that epic blog post)?
- Overestimating how much you can realistically get done in a day (aren’t we all a bit too ambitious 🙃)?
- Love a bit of gamified goal-setting to keep things fun?

## How to Get Started with FocusBoost ✍️
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Open Chrome and navigate to** `chrome://extensions/`, then enable **Developer mode** (toggle is in the top right).

4. **Pin it to your toolbar**, and you’re all set to boost your productivity!

## Fun Fact 💁
The Pomodoro Technique, crafted by developer Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, gets its name from the Italian word for tomato—pomodoro—because the method was originally timed with a tomato-shaped kitchen timer. How’s that for a fun twist?
